                        <a href="https://wtlam01.github.io/GWDs-weekly-coding1/">coding worksheet 1</a>
                    </div>
                    <p>I have learned to set up a repository on GitHub and link it with Visual Studio Code. It was
                        amazing to commit my work to GitHub. It was important to add meaningful comments to show the
                        documentation clearly of the work's process. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="coding-group">
                    <h3>Week 2 & 3 -- Coding Worksheet 2 & 3</h3>
                    <div class="coding-link">
                        <a href="https://wtlam01.github.io/WS2-3-gwds/">coding worksheet 2 & 3</a>
                    </div>
                    <p>In week 2, I learnt to use tags like head, title, and body to create a html file. Then I learned
                        some block-level elements and inline elements. These contributed to the structure and content of
                        the webpage.</p>
                    <p>I was a little confused as coding was a new thing to me. I was a little bit following the worksheets
                        without understanding. So I found some YouTube for extra learning. I created my own notebooks to
                        put down the meanings and details of tags, which helped me learn better.</p>
                    <p>In week 3, I focused on how to write in CSS code. It required me to add the stylesheet and link
                        the HTML file to the CSS file. I experimented with styling elements, like adding colours,
                        padding, margins, and flexbox.</p>
                    <p>I made a mistake in my CSS file. At first, I had no idea why my container didn't work. With the
                        double-check, I realized that I had spelt the word wrongly. It was fun to enhance the page's
                        aesthetics and structure.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="coding-group">
                    <h3>Week 5 -- Coding Worksheet 4</h3>
                    <div class="coding-link">
                        <a href="https://wtlam01.github.io/GWDS-Coding4/">coding worksheet 4</a>
                    </div>
                    <p>In week 4, flexbox was very useful as it could create items, menus, embedding videos or other
                        media types. I was in trouble when I tried to arrange the element horizontally, as I mixed up
                        the main and cross axes in F\flexbox. I wanted to have a better understanding of the work, so I
                        watched YouTube and learned the code details. For example, embedding media like YouTube videos
                        and audio files. I had skills in integrating multimedia content.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="coding-group">
                    <h3>Week 6 -- Coding Worksheet 5</h3>
                    <div class="coding-link">
                        <a href="https://wtlam01.github.io/Coding-gwds-5/">coding worksheet 5</a>
                    </div>
                    <p>It wasn't hard to make a linking button. However, I faced difficulty in adding a Google and Adobe
                        web font. I have checked a few times and couldn't find the mistakes, the font style didn't
                        appear. So I tried to redo the whole worksheet twice. The second time, the font style appeared.
                        I was happy about it.</p>
                    <p>It is significant to choose colour themes for efficient styling. Adobe Colors provided a colour
                        palette, I could get used to it. This improved the webpage's aesthetics.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="coding-group">
                    <h3>Week 6 -- Optional Carousel Worksheet</h3>
                    <div class="coding-link">
                        <a href=" https://wtlam01.github.io/Optional-worksheet/">Optional Carousel Worksheet</a>
                    </div>
                    <p>I gained a lot with the extra worksheet as the process of Deleting problematic styles gradually
                        and checking the effects after each deletion is meaningful.</p>

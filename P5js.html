            <h3>Design and Evaluation Report</h3>
            <h4>Desgin</h4>
            <p>For the contrast theme, I designed a canvas depicting the four seasons, aiming to showcase the stark
                differences between them. Hovanesyan's code inspired me to create a landscape view, which prompted the
                idea of representing the diverse elements of each season through various colours and components. Looking
                at Zheng's code emphasizing the changes in trees across seasons further influenced my approach. Drawing
                inspiration from Agathaco's code, I expanded my design to include more intricate details.</p>
            <p>Simkovic's work (2019) served as inspiration for incorporating dynamic, moving elements into my artwork,
                aligning with the theme of Randomisation. Adir (2020) further reinforced the idea expressing that the
                use of random to make elements appear is fun. To infuse an endearing quality into my creations, I
                explored cute elements, like Chand's teddy bear code (2022), which immediately brought to mind the
                universally popular claw machine. Walker's work provided additional inspiration in this direction.
                Utilizing the random function, I depicted pandas, bears, and chickens within the artwork. This technique
                added whimsy to my work.</p>
            <p>In exploring the theme of repetition, I sought to leverage loops to create patterns and sequences.
                Drawing inspiration from CorelDRAW's concept (2023), I learned that repetition not only fostered a sense
                of familiarity but also instilled a soothing essence within the design. So I had an idea to create a
                game. Reviewing games created by the Create & Learn Team (2022), the prevalence of repeated patterns and
                shapes became evident. This insight led me to conceptualize a static game environment. Carnes' post
                (2019), detailing the development of a Super Mario Brothers game underscored the significance of
                recurring components like water pipes, floors, and coins. Drawing from this, I incorporated intricate
                details within my design to emphasize repetition. This exploration and integration of repetition echoed
                CorelDRAW's wisdom but also aligned with the fundamental principles illustrated by established game
                designs.</p>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <h4>Evaluation</h4>
            <p>I think my coding effectively communicates the intended themes of repetition, contrast, and
                randomization. For repetition, I extensively used loops to create various shapes and patterns. The most
                successful aspect was employing a wide range of programming concepts within this theme. The different
                elements portrayed a sense of cuteness. One area for potential improvement could be introducing an
                animated character within this otherwise static composition, providing an interactive element for users
                to engage with.</p>
            <p>Regarding contrast, the colours and elements vividly illustrate the differences between each season. I
                aimed to showcase these differences by incorporating distinct elements such as snowmen and snow for
                winter, falling leaves for autumn, a sailboat and seabirds for summer, and various flowers for spring.
                To enhance this composition further, I believe I could introduce additional details or elements when I
                have more skills. For instance, improving the depiction of trees by adding more intricate details and
                exploring methods to alter the angles of falling leaves.</p>
            <p>In terms of randomization, the dolls appear randomly within the artwork. I successfully utilised various
                programming concepts for this theme. However, I encountered difficulties in enabling the doll to follow
                the claw once it was touched. This diminished user interaction. Despite this challenge, I attempted an
                alternative approach using bounce and if statements. The claw changes direction upon reaching the edges
                of the rectangle.</p>
            <p>Overall, for further improvements, I believe certain elements could be clearer or more refined, such as
                improving the texture of snow and adding movement to falling leaves. Utilising more intricate and
                complex shapes instead of simple 2D shapes could enhance the overall visual appeal and depth of the
                compositions. To make the work better in the future, I would like to expand my repertoire by delving
                into the application of audio and music. I aspire to incorporate these auditory elements into my work to
                elevate its immersive quality. With more learning experience, I would explore the creation of a game
                through coding. This endeavour not only offers an avenue for skill development but also presents an
                exciting opportunity to apply my creative vision within a different realm.</p>

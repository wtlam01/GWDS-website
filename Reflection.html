                <p>Working on this project, I have gained a lot of insights into graphic design, web design, and typography. Graphic design has been a challenging area for me, and I felt like I could only achieve the basic requirement to use four principles in my work. The outcome was not good at all. Viewing various poster designs online inspired me to design better. During a discussion with my professor, she provided me with guidance like I could try to change the direction of the text. So it would not be like just randomly putting the information in the corner. The advice improved the visual impact of my poster. Despite my work not meeting my personal expectations, I was proud of the effort and dedication I had put into this learning process.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For my website, I designed an ocean theme. I added some marine life illustrations for visual appeal. Initially, as I completed the coursework so quickly, the professor provided me with some feedback about the traditional font style used in the title. I could seek a more suitable option. As I recall I had learned to change some style in coding worksheet 5, so I chose something cute in Google Fonts and applied it to my website. As the background was too monotony. Chandra (2023) provided some examples of background patterns, so I learned from them and decorated my website.</p>
                <br>
                <p>One of the challenges I encountered while constructing my website was implementing responsive design, ensuring that the content restructures gracefully when the browser window is resized. With the examples by W3Schools, I learnt from it and successfully applied it to my website. Moreover, I experimented with different font styles, With Williams and Gustavo’s work, which notably enhanced the overall presentation of my website. As coding is relatively new to me, I watched YouTube and created my own notebook for deeper insights.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The typographic design was enjoyable, designing those systems and the outcome were so rewarding. Among the challenging designs were grid and modular, it was not easy to design a unique one. Engaging in discussions with my professor was incredibly beneficial, their feedback helped me to improve my work. For the whole assignment, I broke down the text to suit the required layout needs. With the use of lines and shapes to enhance visual appeal.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Throughout this semester of this project, I recognised the importance of perseverance in the face of challenges. Despite there were difficulties in the design, the process of independent learning and seeking inspiration online fueled my determination to improve. The constructive feedback from my professors fostered a deeper understanding and made adjustments to enhance my work.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Acknowledging my current skill level, I am eager to delve deeper into graphic design to refine my abilities. Particularly in mastering colour implementation, refining image placement and positioning techniques. This pursuit aims to elevate the visual impact within my designs. Furthermore, I aim to expand my coding knowledge and showcase a higher level of technical finesse to create a more animated version of my website.</p>
